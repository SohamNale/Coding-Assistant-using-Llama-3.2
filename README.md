# Coding-Assistant-using-Llama-3.2
This repository contains three implementations of a code assistant using the Ollama Llama 3.2 model running on a local machine. The assistant provides detailed, step-by-step guidance for writing code, troubleshooting errors, and solving coding-related queries across multiple programming languages and frameworks.

Setup Ollama Llama 3.2
Ensure you have the Ollama Llama 3.2 model running on your local machine. The API should be accessible at http://localhost:11434/api/generate.
Install the required Python packages:
'''pip install requests gradio tkinter pyinstaller
1. Gradio Chat Interface (code_assistant.py)
This implementation uses Gradio's ChatInterface to create a simple and fast LLM chat interface.

Running the Code
Run the code_assistant.py script:
Code Explanation
The call_ollama_api function interacts with the Ollama API, incorporating the conversation history into the prompt.
The chat_fn function handles the chat interaction, updating the history and returning the assistant's response.
The Gradio interface is set up using gr.ChatInterface with context history enabled.

2. Gradio Custom Chatbot (code_assistant_modular.py)
This implementation uses Gradio's Chatbot function to create a customizable UI with additional buttons for retry, undo, and clear functionalities.

Running the Code
Run the code_assistant_modular.py script:
Code Explanation
The llama_chat function handles the chat interaction, updating the conversation history and user inputs.
The retry_last, undo_last, and clear_chat functions provide additional functionalities for retrying, undoing, and clearing the chat.
The Gradio interface is set up with custom buttons for retry, undo, and clear actions.
3. Tkinter Local UI (code_assistant_app.py)
This implementation uses the Tkinter library to create a local UI, which can be converted to a Windows executable file using PyInstaller.

Running the Code
Run the code_assistant_app.py script:
Code Explanation
The llama_chat function handles the chat interaction, updating the conversation history and user inputs.
The update_chat_display, on_send, on_retry, on_redo, and on_clear functions manage the UI interactions.
The Tkinter UI is set up with a chat display area, input entry box, and action buttons for send, retry, redo, and clear actions.
Converting to Executable
To convert the code_assistant_app.py script to a Windows executable file using PyInstaller, run the following command:

This will generate a dist folder containing the code_assistant_app.exe file.

Conclusion
These three implementations provide different ways to interact with the Ollama Llama 3.2 model, each with its own advantages. Choose the one that best fits your needs and enjoy the assistance in your coding journey!
